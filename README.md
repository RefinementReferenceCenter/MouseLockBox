The deposit contains 3D printable STL files for the Lock Boxes (LB), which were used in the project “Mouse Lock Box” funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany’s Excellence Strategy – EXC 2002/1 “Science of Intelligence” – project number 390523135: https://www.scienceofintelligence.de/research/researchprojects/project_03/

**Background**: Against the background of studies demonstrating sequential problem solving in cockatoos, we developed complex mechanical puzzles, so-called LB, for mice and investigated their problem-solving strategies. Besides this, the impact of the lock box enrichment on the affective state of the mice was investigated.

**LB sets**: Two LB sets were designed, each consisting of four single mechanism LBs(1-step) and a combined mechanism LBs (4-step). For the latter, the fours single mechanisms block each other and have to be removed in the correct order to open the box. The LB can be baited with a food reward to motivate the animals to open them.  
In the folder titled *"LB_solutions"*, there are GIFs of each single and combined mechanism LB, which demonstrate how the LBs are supposed to be opened.  
In the construction manual *("Instruction_Manual_Lock_Boxes.pdf")*, the STL files for each LB are listed and construction plans are provided. The STL files can be found in the folder titled *"LB_sets.zip"*.

**Printing**: We used an Ultimaker 3 Extended and an Ultimaker S3, 0.4 mm nozzles, and PLA of different colors as material. The gcode was generated with Cura_SteamEngine 4.4.0. Since the mice may gnaw on the LB, it is advisable to choose a higher value for the thickness of walls and top, e.g., 1.5 mm. For most elements, the normal profile (0.15 mm) can be used; for small elements such as the seals, the fine profile is beneficial.  
- Wall Thickness: 1 mm
- Wall Line Count: 10 mm
- Top/Bottom Thickness: 1 mm
- Top Layers: 10 
- Bottom Layers: 3
- Infill Density: 20 %
- Infill Pattern: Triangles
- Support should be generated for the following elements: LB#1_single_drawer.stl, LB#1_single_cube.stl, LB#1_single_disc.stl, LB#2_single_lever.stl, LB#2_single_stick.stl, LB#1_combined_stick.stl, LB#1_combined_cube.stl, LB#1_combined_disc.stl, LB#2_combined_ lever.stl, LB#2_combined_ stick1.stl, LB#2_combined_ stick2.stl
- Build Plate Adhesion is necessary for the following elements: LB#1_single_drawer.stl, LB#1_single_lever.stl; LB#1_single_seal1.stl, LB#1_single_cube.stl, LB#1_single_seal2.stl, LB#2_single_lever.stl, LB#2_single_stick.stl, LB#2_single_seal4.stl, LB#2_single_seal5.stl, LB#2_single_seal6.stl, LB#1_combined_stick.stl, LB#1_combined_lever.stl, LB#1_combined_cube.stl, LB#1_combined_seal1.stl, LB#1_combined_seal2.stl, LB#2_combined_lever.stl, LB#2_combined_stick1.stl, LB#2_combined_stick2.stl, LB#2_combined_ball.stl, LB#2_combined_seal3.stl, LB#2_combined_seal6.stl
